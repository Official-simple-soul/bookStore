What you will learn. In \"The Road to React\" you will learn about all the fundamentals of React.js with Hooks while building a full-blown React application step by step. While you create the React application, every chapter will introduce you to a new React key feature. However, there is more than only the fundamentals: The book dives into related topics (e.g. React with TypeScript, Testing, Performance Optimizations) and advanced feature implementations like client- and server-side searching. At the end of the book, you will have a fully working deployed React application. Is it up to date? Programming books are usually outdated soon after their release, but since this book is self- published, I can update it as needed whenever a new version of something related to this book gets released. I am a beginner. Is this book for me? Yes. The book starts from zero and takes you through the learning experience step by step. Every chapter builds up on the learnings from the previous chapter. In addition, at the end of every chapter, exercises fortify your lessons learned. If you got stuck in a chapter, you will always find a reference URL to the status quo of the actual code. Core Concepts Pragmatic: Master React while building a complete application step by step. Problems Solving: You need to experience a problem first before solving it. The Why: Readers like how the book answers the Why, not only the How.

This book also covers many other complementary tools: React Router, GraphQL, React-Bootstrap, Babel, and Webpack. This new edition will use the latest version of React (React 16) and the latest React Router (React Router 4), which has a significantly different approach to routing compared to React Router 2 which was used in the first edition of the book. Though the primary focus of Pro MERN Stack is to equip you with all that is required to build a full-fledged web application, a large portion of the book will be devoted to React 16. The popular MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node) stack introduced Single Page Apps (SPAs) and front-end Model-View-Controller (MVC) as new and efficient paradigms. Facebook's React is a technology that competes indirectly with AngularJS. It is not a full-fledged MVC framework. It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (in some sense the View part). Yet, it is possible to build a web app by replacing AngularJS with React – hence the term MERN stack What You Will Learn Discover the features of React 16 to get the maximum out of this library Gain the basics of MongoDB, Express, and Node to build a web app Work with other libraries complementary to React, including React-Bootstrap, React Router, and GraphQL Use tools such as Babel and Webpack required to build JavaScript-based SPAs Tie all the components together to build a complete web app. Who This Book Is For Developers and architects who have prior experience in any web app stack other than the MERN stack will find the book useful to learn about this modern stack. Prior knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is required.",

What you will learn. In \"The Road to React\" you will learn about all the fundamentals of React.js with Hooks while building a full-blown React application step by step. While you create the React application, every chapter will introduce you to a new React key feature. However, there is more than only the fundamentals: The book dives into related topics (e.g. React with TypeScript, Testing, Performance Optimizations) and advanced feature implementations like client- and server-side searching. At the end of the book, you will have a fully working deployed React application. Is it up to date? Programming books are usually outdated soon after their release, but since this book is self- published, I can update it as needed whenever a new version of something related to this book gets released. I am a beginner. Is this book for me? Yes. The book starts from zero and takes you through the learning experience step by step. Every chapter builds up on the learnings from the previous chapter. In addition, at the end of every chapter, exercises fortify your lessons learned. If you got stuck in a chapter, you will always find a reference URL to the status quo of the actual code. Core Concepts Pragmatic: Master React while building a complete application step by step. Problems Solving: You need to experience a problem first before solving it.

With this hands-on guide, you’ll learn how to build applications that target iOS, Android, and other mobile platforms instead of browsers. You’ll also discover how to access platform features such as the camera, user location, and local storage. With code examples and step-by-step instructions, author Bonnie Eisenman shows web developers and frontend engineers how to build and style interfaces, use mobile components, and debug and deploy apps. Along the way, you’ll build several increasingly sophisticated sample apps with React Native before putting everything together at the end. Learn how React Native provides an interface to native UI components Examine how the framework uses native components analogous to HTML elements Create and style your own React Native components and applications Install modules for APIs and features not supported by the framework Get tools for debugging your code, and for handling issues outside of JavaScript Put it all together with the Zebreto effective-memorization flashcard app Deploy apps to the iOS App Store and Google’s Play Store",

Node.js is a scalable application server that is used in thousands of websites, while GraphQL is becoming the standard way for large websites to provide data and services to their users. Together, these technologies, when reinforced with the capabilities of TypeScript, provide a cutting-edge stack for complete web application development. This book takes a hands-on approach to implementing modern web technologies and the associated methodologies for building full-stack apps. You’ll begin by gaining a strong understanding of TypeScript and how to use it to build high-quality web apps. The chapters that follow delve into client-side development with React using the new Hooks API and Redux. Next, you’ll get to grips with server-side development with Express, including authentication with Redis-based sessions and accessing databases with TypeORM. The book will then show you how to use Apollo GraphQL to build web services for your full-stack app. Later, you’ll learn how to build GraphQL schemas and integrate them with React using Hooks. Finally, you’ll focus on how to deploy your application onto an NGINX server using the AWS cloud. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to build and deploy complete high-performance web applications using React, Node, and GraphQL. What you will learnDiscover TypeScript’s most important features and how they can be used to improve code quality and maintainabilityUnderstand what React Hooks are and how to build React apps using themImplement state management for your React app using ReduxSet up an Express project with TypeScript and GraphQL from scratchBuild a fully functional online forum app using React and GraphQLAdd authentication to your web app using RedisSave and retrieve data from a Postgres database using TypeORMConfigure NGINX on the AWS cloud to deploy and serve your appsWho this book is for The book is for web developers who want to go beyond front-end web development and enter the world of full-stack web development by learning about modern web technologies and how they come together.

This book also covers many other complementary tools: React Router, GraphQL, React-Bootstrap, Babel, and Webpack. This new edition will use the latest version of React (React 16) and the latest React Router (React Router 4), which has a significantly different approach to routing compared to React Router 2 which was used in the first edition of the book. Though the primary focus of Pro MERN Stack is to equip you with all that is required to build a full-fledged web application, a large portion of the book will be devoted to React 16. The popular MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node) stack introduced Single Page Apps (SPAs) and front-end Model-View-Controller (MVC) as new and efficient paradigms. Facebook's React is a technology that competes indirectly with AngularJS. It is not a full-fledged MVC framework. It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (in some sense the View part). Yet, it is possible to build a web app by replacing AngularJS with React – hence the term MERN stack What You Will Learn Discover the features of React 16 to get the maximum out of this library Gain the basics of MongoDB, Express, and Node to build a web app Work with other libraries complementary to React, including React-Bootstrap, React Router, and GraphQL Use tools such as Babel and Webpack required to build JavaScript-based SPAs Tie all the components together to build a complete web app. Who This Book Is For Developers and architects who have prior experience in any web app stack other than the MERN stack will find the book useful to learn about this modern stack. Prior knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is required.",
